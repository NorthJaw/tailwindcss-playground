# Demo app to play around with new [TailwindCSS] (https://tailwindcss.com) features

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

As of Sept 2021, [CRA does not support PostCSS 8] (https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/9664). Hence tailwindcss/postcss7-compat, postCSS 7 are used in this project ([Install guide (https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app)]).

JIT mode is enabled in Tailwind.
